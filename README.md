# ostree-cachyos
This is a custom image of Fedora Silverblue with the CachyOS kernel integrated.

This image was built by the people behind the CachyOS kernel for Fedora project (https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/bieszczaders/kernel-cachyos) for Fedora Silverblue 39.
At the time of writing it's not possible to install our kernel on a running Silverblue 39 installation, hence we provide this custom made image as a solution to this problem until a solution is being found.
